If not already set, make the installer executable with `chmod +x ./limd-install.sh`\r\n\r\n2 - Run the installer with `sudo` as the prefix is not by default added to it. For example, you will see `apt-get install something` instead of `sudo apt-get install something` in the installer file. This is so that root users don't get 'no need to run as sudo!' messages constantly.\r\n\r\n3 - After connecting the device and the installer has given the details of the device, you should try running `idevicepair`.\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\nVERSION: v1.0\r\n",
